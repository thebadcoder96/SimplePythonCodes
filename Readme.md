# Fun Python Scripts 

Here I will be trying out some fun, interesting and easy-to-understand codes that I practice when I am bored.

## Projects

- #### **Text2Speech** 
    Using pyttsx3 library to convert text to speech. The library is easy and has options to configure some of the voice settings. Code in the [*Text2Speech.py*](Text2Voice/Text2Voice.py) file.
- #### **RedditBot** 
    Using PRAW, a simple library for using the Reddit API, to make a reddit bot that replies to a word or phrase. Please refer the [Readme file](https://github.com/thebadcoder96/SimplePythonCodes/blob/master/RedditBot/Readme.md) in the folder for more information. Code in the [*CatBot.py*](RedditBot/CatBot.py) file.
- #### **AutoInsta** 
    Automating liking, commenting and following people/posts on instagram as per given tags. Please refer the [Readme file](https://github.com/thebadcoder96/SimplePythonCodes/blob/master/AutoInsta/Readme.md) for more information on how to work it. Code in the [*Insta.py*](AutoInta/Insta.py) file.
